VoiceVista helps you stay aware of where you are and where you're going by using
unique audio guidance and by calling out roads, intersections, and places as you
approach them.

VoiceVista uses 3D sound to let you know what's around you. For example, if your
destination is on your right,you will hear sound coming from that direction, or
if a coffee shop is on your left, you will hear a callout from that direction.

Place an audio beacon on your destination and VoiceVista will keep you informed
of its location and your surroundings along the way. Use VoiceVista in
conjunction with your wayfinding skills and even your favorite navigation app to
find your way to your destination.

Put away the phone and walk. VoiceVista will help you stay aware of where you
are by calling out roads, intersections, and landmarks as you approach them.
Callouts can be adjusted in the settings.

Hold the phone flat in your hand, and use the buttons to locate roads and
upcoming intersections, orient to familiar landmarks around you, and explore
landmarks ahead of you.

People often think about apps in terms of "what problem is this app good at
solving?" VoiceVista certainly can be used on a case by case basis when you have
a specific information need – such as keeping track of a destination as you make
your way there, helping to orient yourself when you emerge from a metro station,
getting your bearings when exiting a car, or finding the street names for, or
distance to, the next intersection.

However, the philosophy behind VoiceVista is one of "lighting up your world with
sound", designed to be used anytime you are out and about to provide ambient
awareness of your surroundings, such as keeping you aware of the names of the
streets you are on, the direction you are heading, and the names of businesses
you are passing.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-2)

When using any button within this tab, hold your phone with the screen flat
(facing towards the sky) and the top of the phone pointing in the direction you
are facing before you press the button. This acts like a compass telling the app
which direction you are facing.

Double tapping the *"What's My Location"* button quickly gives you information
that helps you figure out where you currently are. It tells you about your
current location including things like the direction you are facing, where
nearby roads or intersections are, and where nearby points of interest are.

Swiping down on the *"What's My Location"* button allows you to either save your
current location as a marker or share your current location.

Double tapping the *"What's Around Me"* button tells you about one thing in each
of the four quadrants around you (ahead, to the right, behind, and to the left).  
Swiping down on this button will give you options to hear markers or list places
which are near by. The *"Nearby Markers"* action tells you about up to four
markers that are closest to you. When you are trying to get your bearings and
orient yourself to your surroundings, use *"Nearby Places"* to list the
locations of places you know of.

Double tapping the *"What's Ahead of Me"* button tells you about four things
ahead of you. Swiping down on this button will give you options to hear a list
of intersections which are ahead of you.

Double tapping the “repeat last call out button repeats the last announcement
VoiceVista has made.”

The final piece of information on this page is the “location accuracy” which
will tell you to the nearest meter the expected GPS accuracy at that moment in
time.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-2-1)

Markers are any location you wish to save for future reference; they could be a
destination, point of interest you notice when out and about or a waypoint
created as part of a route. Features relating to markers can be accessed from
the “Markers” tab which is the second tab.

You can save your current location as a marker by selecting the "Markers" tab
and then tapping top right of the screen on the “Current Location” button. You
can also accomplish this by swiping down on the “what’s my location” button from
the “surroundings tab” and double tapping “add current.”

You can save other locations as a marker by selecting "Places Nearby" or the
“Search places” item in "Surroundings" tab, and then searching for the place you
would like to save using the search bar, or finding somewhere from the
categorized list of nearby places.

Selecting the “add” button from the “markers” tab gives you a number of other
ways of adding markers including via searching, selecting a location on a map,
inputting longtitude and latitude co-ordinates, importing from other GPS
applications or pasting a uRL from Apple Maps,

Once you have found the place you would like, selecting it will take you to the
"Location Details" page. On this page, tap the button on the top right.

You can mark any place or address, but you can also mark things that might
traditionally not be available in maps, for example, entrances to buildings or
parks, push-to-walk buttons, pedestrian crossings or bridges, bus stops or even
your dog's favourite tree and use these as references along your walk.

VoiceVista will automatically call out marked places as you walk by or approach
them, or you can also use the “Nearby markers button” found by swiping down on
the “around me” button from the “surroundings” tab to hear a spatial callout of
marked places around you.

In addition, you have the ability to set an audio beacon on any marked place.
When you do this, the VoiceVista audio beacon you are familiar with, will be
heard and you can operate it as usual.

You have the option to customise saved markers. If you want to, you can change
the name of the marker and also add an annotation that will be called out along
with the marker to provide some extra information.

A list of all markers you have saved can be accessed from the “markers,” tab
which you can organize by distance or alphabetically by name.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-3)

You may want to create and use a route somewhere you know to make sure you keep
on track, or you may want to use it as a tool to help familiarise yourself along
a new journey.

**Creating a route**:  
Select the "Routes" tab, and then select the "Add" button in the top-right
corner. Select the “create a new route” button; then give the route a name and
an optional description. To complete the route you need to add waypoints. You
can do this as you travel using the breadcrumb mode feature, by picking them
from your list of already saved Markers or by adding waypoints based on an
algorithm i.e. automatically placing a marker at a pre-determined distance such
as every 100 meters. You can rearrange the order of the waypoints along a route
at any time by editing the route.

VoiceVista also provides you the option when creating a route to import routes
you have already created using soundscape or any other application which can
save routes you have done as a GPX file type.

**Editing a route**:  
Select your route from the list of all routes on the "Routes" tab and then
select "Edit Route Name" or "Edit Waypoints" in the top right corner. From here
you can add, reorder and remove waypoints, as well as editing the name and
description of the route. You also have the option to automatically create a
reversed version or circular version of the route.

**Sharing a route**:  
Select your route on the "Routes" tab and then select the option to "Share"
using all of the usual share options available to you.

As with the “surroundings” tab you can swipe down on options to reveal
additional available actions.

Use the button at the top left to sort your routes by name or distance away from
you.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-3-1)

From the location details screen you can select the "Start Beacon" button.
Tapping this will return you to the home screen and turn on an audible beacon
coming from the direction of the place you selected. The name of the place you
have selected along with its distance and physical address, if available, will
now be displayed on the main app screen.

Setting a beacon on a nearby location allows VoiceVista to keep you informed by
playing an audible beacon sound coming from the direction of that location. This
beacon can be muted or unmuted on the home screen. Additionally, VoiceVista
displays information about the location on the home screen including the
distance to it and its street address if it is known.

Setting a beacon is useful when you want to keep track of a familiar landmark as
you explore a new area or when you are going somewhere and want to be informed
about your surroundings along the way. The beacon feature does not give you
turn-by-turn directions, but it does give you a continuous audible sound that
tells you the direction to the beacon, relative to where you are currently
located. Using the audio beacon, your existing wayfinding skills, and even your
favourite navigation app, you can choose how you want to get to nearby locations
yourself.

**To set a beacon**:  
First, view the details for a location by either using the search bar to search
for a place, or tapping one of the "Places Nearby", "Saved Markers", or "Current
Location" buttons and selecting a location. From the location details screen you
can select the "Start Audio Beacon" button. Tapping this will return you to the
home screen and turn on an audible beacon coming from the direction of the place
you selected. The name of the place you have selected along with its distance
and physical address, if available, will now be displayed on the “Surroundings”
tab.

**To remove the current beacon**:  
Simply press the "Remove Beacon" button on the home screen.

**To mute the audible beacon**:  
Tap the "Mute Beacon" button underneath the "Remove Beacon" button on the home
screen.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-4)

Like a lighthouse, it does not tell you how to get there – you may need to make
many navigation choices along the way, just as a sailboat will have to make many
strategic "tacks" to get closer to the lighthouse.

The continuous rhythmic sound of the audible beacon is spatialised from the
direction of the destination, and helps you stay aware of the location of the
destination relative to you as you walk.

When you are walking directly toward the destination, or you point the phone
toward the destination, a higher pitched "ring" sound will be heard.

This feature allows you to pinpoint the direction of the destination since the
direction of the rhythmic sound can sometimes be difficult to perceive in loud
environments. When searching for the higher pitched "ring", hold the phone flat
and sweep the phone slowly; turning your head to point in the same direction of
the phone will ensure that you have the best spatial audio experience.

The lighthouse metaphor for the beacon's design has several natural
implications:

1.  There is no "correct" direction to travel when using the beacon, instead,
    with VoiceVista you choose how to get there;

2.  The higher pitched "ring" helps you pinpoint the direction of the
    destination only – it is not an indication of how you should get there;

3.  If you generally know how to get to your destination, you may wish to mute
    the beacon for the majority of your trip and turn it on only as you get
    closer to your destination. You can also use the “monitoring” feature
    instead which will not play a sound or announce any distance to the marker
    until you are a specified distance away. The “start monitoring” button can
    be accessed from the marker details page. [TOC](faq.html#q-5)

Most often this occurs if you have been walking with the phone stored in a
pocket or bag, and you stop moving, such as to cross a street. The beacon will
get louder once you start moving again, or if you hold the phone flat and point
it in the direction you are facing.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-6)

VoiceVista uses spatial audio to indicate the name of the road that goes to the
left, the name of the road that continues straight ahead, and the name of the
road that goes to the right, in that order.

If the description of the intersection begins with the road you are on rather
than one to the left, then the intersection is a T with the road you are on
continuing ahead and a road intersecting from the right.

Similarly, if the description only includes a road to the left and to the right,
you will know that the road you are on ends at a T ahead of you. This method of
describing intersections also supports the case when a road changes name at an
intersection.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-11)

If a business or point of interest is not announced by VoiceVista, the most
probable reason is that the business has not been added, or in some cases
updated, by a member of the OSM community yet.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-12)

This helps VoiceVista to improve your audio experience making it more natural as
you move around in the world. When you use VoiceVista with AirPods connected,
you do not need to hold your phone for VoiceVista to work correctly.

You can use AirPods with VoiceVista anytime you would normally use VoiceVista.
Using AirPods provides you with high quality audio and allows you to have a more
hands-free experience with VoiceVista.

**Connecting a Device**:  
Go to the "Head Tracking Headphones" item in the VoiceVista menu to connect your
AirPods and follow the instructions on screen. Note that you will need to pair
your AirPods to your phone in the Bluetooth settings before connecting them in
VoiceVista.

**Using the Media Controls on your Headphones**:  
When media controls are enabled in the VoiceVista settings, you can use the
media controls on your AirPods to mute or unmute the beacon, call out your
location or to repeat the last callout.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-16)

This functionality works with any wired or Bluetooth headphones that have media
control buttons like Play, Pause, Next, Previous and others. Different
headphones may include different buttons so please refer to the list of actions
below to determine which ones are available to you.

Also note that this feature only works with headphones that support Apple's
media controls (such as play and pause).

Headphone media controls can be used while VoiceVista is running. This is true
whether you are currently in VoiceVista or while VoiceVista is in the background
and even while your device is locked. Note however that headphone media control
buttons will not work with VoiceVista if you are playing audio like music,
podcasts or videos with another app.

You can access the following features in VoiceVista using your the media control
buttons on your headphones:

⏯ Play/Pause: Mute any current callouts and if the audio beacon is set, toggle
the beacon audio.  
⏭ Next: Callout *"My Location"*.  
⏮ Previous: Repeat last callout.  
⏩ Skip Forward: Toggle callouts On and Off.  
⏪ Skip Backward: Callout *"Around Me"*.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-16-1)

To help minimise the impact on your iPhone battery VoiceVista now has a Sleep
Mode and a Snooze Mode. Wake it up again by either double tapping the “wake up”
button or request the application to wake up again when you leave your current
location. To further reduce the amount of battery you use, when you aren't using
VoiceVista, you should force close it via your iPhone's App Switcher.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-17)

1.  Turn the screen display off as much as possible when you are not interacting
    with the app.

2.  When not using the app, close it down. VoiceVista uses location services
    continually when it is running so that it always knows your location, even
    when you are not moving. Don't forget to restart the app when you resume
    your journey.

3.  In cold weather, keep your phone warm as batteries perform more poorly in
    colder temperatures. [TOC](faq.html#q-21)

To reduce the amount of mobile data you use, make sure you are connected to
Wi-Fi whenever possible, particularly to download the app. When you are not
using VoiceVista, you should use the "Sleep" button to put VoiceVista to sleep
or force close the app.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-22)

For example, if you pass a shop on your right, you will hear the name of the
shop sounding from your right. As you approach an intersection, you will hear
each road name sounding from the direction it goes in, beginning to your left,
ahead and to the right.

VoiceVista play an audible beacon in the direction of your destination,
empowering you to make your way there on your terms using your increased
awareness of your surroundings and the location of your destination. And
VoiceVista provides turn by turn directions to the next destination for your
convenient.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-23)

To use VoiceVista with these apps, start your navigation app first. Then, move
over to VoiceVista and set a beacon on the same destination as in the navigation
app. At this point, both apps will be running and you will hear walking
directions from your navigation app, while getting updates on points of
interest, intersections, and your distance to your destination from VoiceVista.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-24)

1.  Immediately stop all audio: Double tap the screen with two fingers to
    immediately turn off all audio, including any callout that is currently
    playing and the beacon if it is on. Callouts will resume automatically when
    you approach the next intersection or point of interest, but the audible
    beacon will not. Select the "unmute beacon button" on the main screen to
    resume hearing the beacon.

2.  Stop automatic callouts: When you are not travelling or have reached a
    destination, you probably will not need VoiceVista to continue to notify you
    of things around you. Instead of exiting the app, you can put VoiceVista in
    to Snooze mode and it will wake up again when you leave, or you can put
    VoiceVista into Sleep mode and it will stay off until you choose to turn it
    back on. Alternatively, you can select "Settings" from the tabs and choose
    to turn all callouts off in the "Manage Callouts" section.

3.  Stop the beacon: There are several scenarios for which you might set a
    destination, but not need the audible beacon on. For example, you may know
    exactly how to get to your destination but want to get automatic updates
    about how far away you are from your destination. Or, you may know roughly
    how to get to your destination, and only need the audio beacon as you near
    your destination. Whatever the case, you can choose when to hear the beacon
    by toggling the "mute beacon"/"unmute beacon" button on the main screen.
    [TOC](faq.html#q-25)

VoiceVista will use the direction you are walking to figure out which callouts
to announce to your left and to your right.

When you stop moving, VoiceVista does not know which direction you are facing.
If the audible beacon is on, you will notice it get quiet until you start moving
again.

You can pull the phone out to press the location and exploration buttons at the
bottom of the screen at any time but make sure to hold the phone with the top of
the phone pointing in the direction you are facing and with the screen to the
sky. In this "flat" position, VoiceVista will use the phone's compass to
determine which way you are facing and provide accurate spatial callouts. If the
beacon is on, you will also notice that it returns to full volume.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-26)

1.  Voice: You can choose which of the available voices on iOS you would like
    VoiceVista to use, as well as the speed at which callouts are spoken. Select
    Settings tab, then Voice to adjust the Speaking Rate and Voice settings.
    Additional voices and enhanced voices with a higher quality can be
    downloaded in the iOS Settings app at Settings \> Accessibility \> Spoken
    Content \> Voices.

2.  Distance Metric: VoiceVista allows you to hear all distances in either feet
    or metres. Open system settings app, change the option of "Measurement
    System General" in "General"/ "Language & Region" page.

3.  Markers: You can mark your world with anything you care about. You can mark
    things that are personal and relevant to you like your home, your office and
    your preferred grocery store. Then VoiceVista will automatically call out
    marked places as you walk by or approach them, or you can also use the
    Nearby Markers button at the bottom of the VoiceVista home screen to hear a
    spatial callout of marked places around you. These markers will remain
    personal to you and will not be available to anyone else.

4.  Callouts: VoiceVista can tell you about things around you as you approach
    them by calling out their name from the direction they are located in. The
    app will do this automatically for all sorts of things like businesses, bus
    stops, and even intersections. You can configure what the app automatically
    calls out in the "Manage Callouts" section of the "Settings" screen, and you
    can turn all callouts off when you want the app to be silent.

In addition to the above, the following VoiceOver settings can influence how
VoiceVista behaves:

1.  VoiceOver Tips: When VoiceOver tips are turned ON, you will hear more
    information about all the buttons on the primary VoiceVista screen. You can
    turn on VoiceOver tips by navigating to the iOS Settings app and going to
    Accessibility \> VoiceOver \> Verbosity, and turning the Speak Hints setting
    on.

2.  Audio Ducking: VoiceVista is designed to work with Audio Ducking turned OFF.
    When Audio Ducking is on, automatic callouts can be difficult to hear if
    VoiceOver is used simultaneously. We recommend turning Audio Ducking off to
    make it easier to hear all automatic callouts that occur as you are
    interacting with the phone. Audio ducking can be turned off in VoiceOver
    settings or via the VoiceOver rotor.

3.  Touch ID or Face ID to Unlock: Setting your phone to unlock using Touch ID
    or Face ID will make unlocking the phone fast and easy, and in turn, allow
    you to access the “What’s My Location”, “What’s Around Me”, and “What’s
    Ahead of Me” buttons as quickly as possible when you are on the go. Set up
    Touch ID or Face ID unlocking in the iOS Settings app.  
    [TOC](faq.html#q-27)

VoiceVista will try to resume normal operation when your phone is connected to
Wi-Fi or mobile data is enabled and you are in an area with good signal. If your
phone does have a good internet connection, but VoiceVista does not resume
normal operation, then there may be an outage in the VoiceVista services.  
[TOC](faq.html#q-29)

1.  Open BlindSquare and go to the “My Places” screen.

2.  Tap the action button in the top right corner of the screen.

3.  Either email the exported file to yourself or save it in the Files app.

    -   If you have emailed the export, open your Mail app, open the email to
        yourself, and tap the attached JSON file to open it. Tap the 'Share'
        button at the bottom of the screen and select VoiceVista.

    -   If you have saved the export to the Files app, open VoiceVista and
        select the Markers tab. Tap the button at the top right of the screen to
        add new markers and select the option to import markers from
        BlindSquare. Please note that only the names and the coordinates of the
        BlindSquare markers will be imported into VoiceVista. Additional
        information for example “Alert Distance” or the accuracy a marker has
        been saved with cannot be imported.  
        [TOC](faq.html#q-30)

You can set a beacon on any address. From the main VoiceVista screen, search for
the address. After selecting the address in the search results, a "Location
Details" screen will be shown and it has an option to "Start Audio Beacon" on
the address. In this way, you can set a beacon on businesses, places, points of
interest, and residences that are not in Open Street Maps.

You can find nearby bus stops by selecting the "Public Transport" filter in the
Nearby Places list.

You can turn on and off the rhythmic sound of the beacon using the mute button
on the home screen. If the beacon is muted you will still get updates about your
distance to your destination every 50 metres or so.

If you still want to interact with VoiceVista but don't want to hear automatic
callouts you can turn callouts off by going to the "Manage Callouts" section of
the "Settings" page from the menu. Or, if you aren't going to be using
VoiceVista you can put it in either Sleep or Snooze mode using the "Sleep"
button on the home screen.

VoiceVista works best when you hold the phone flat with the screen facing the
sky and the top of the phone pointing away from you.

If there is a bus route you take regularly, set your pick-up and exit stops as
Markers. This way they will be saved so you can find them again easily, just go
to "Markers" tab and find them in the list. You can set a beacon on them and you
will get periodic updates on how close you are to your exit stop. Note: you can
turn off the rhythmic sound and you will still get distance updates along the
way.

Tapping the screen twice with two fingers will silence any active callouts.
